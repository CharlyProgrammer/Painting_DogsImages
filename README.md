## ***Design and Development of a convolutional artificial neural network to paint dogs images***

For this project, I trained an AutoEncoder that is a kind of Convolutional Artificial Neural Network in order to paint grayscale dog images. It used images of 10 diferent dog breeds in grayscale to train a model which allows to retrieve the color version of any dog image that it receives as input. The dog breeds of the Stanford Dogs Dataset which I used to work and build the training and testing dataset are the following:

  * Beagle
  * Bernese mountain dog
  * Boxer
  * Doberman
  * German shepherd
  * Golden retriever
  * Rottweiler
  * Saint Bernard
  * Shetland sheepdog
  * Welsh springer spaniel

The specific details about this project can be summarized in the followings points:

  * DataBase --> the Stanford Dogs Dataset.
  * The Neural Network must work with images that have a size of 256x256 pixels.
  * Testing the Neural Network using additional photos that were downloaded from internet was a good way to see if the algorithm works properly.
  * Even though the network was not designed to work with other kind of pictures, it was interesting to experiment with the performance on the system using photos of a different kind of animal as cats.
  * Making a graph or visual representation of the training and testing errors as a function of the number of epochs was an important task.
  * Construction of a report that shows the Summary of all the layers of the Neural Network was another important task.
  * It was necessary to show a colored version of a Beagle breed dog as an example image vs the result of the model for that particular sample.
